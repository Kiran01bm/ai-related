# General Notes

## AI for Content Recommendations - Deliver sophisticated content recommendations to users based on their previous habits and interests.

## AI for Voice assistant program called DuerOS that has a significantly higher number of conversation based skill sets when compared to Alexa, Cortana, or Siri. 

## AI for Cyber Security 
1. CloudWalk Technology Co. Ltd is an artificial intelligence focused technology company based in Guangzhou, China.
2. Darktrace is a lead player in the world of cyber defence. The company is best known for the Darktrace Enterprise Immune System, which combines artificial intelligence algorithms with machine learning to build a unique “pattern of life” for every device, network and user. It then uses correlation techniques to create an advanced understanding of “normal activity” meaning that any potential threats or unusual activity, however new or advanced it may be can be quickly identified and stopped before too much damage is done. Another Darktrace product, the Darktrace Cloud gives users real time threat protection and is used by **Amazon Web Services** amongst others.
3. CrowdStrike uses artificial intelligence to deliver sophisticated endpoint protection. This technology has enabled the company to reveal the identity of a number of high profile and **state sponsored** hackers.

## AI for Facial Recongnition - Another Chinese company that specialises in artificial intelligence and facial recognition SenseTime has a significant presence in Japan, China and Hong Kong.

## AI for Healthcare
1. IBM Watson
2. Zebra Medical Vision (based in Israel) is a medical imaging insights platform.It is leading the way for artificial intelligence companies utilising deep learning techniques to enhance the field of **radiology**. Zebra Medical Vision’s open clinical research platform allows researchers from around the world access to millions of indexed clinical records. The aim of this is to, hopefully, accelerate scientific discovery, encourage collaboration and shorten development cycles.
3. Babylon - A subsctitue for GP screening - Babylon claims it’s AI chatbot can diagnose medical conditions as accurately as a Doctor sparking a row with UK doctors.

## AI for Fintech
1. Affirm (a California based financial technology services firm) does this by using artificial intelligence to conduct a **soft credit check** which quickly assess the users ability to pay
2. Upstart is a lending platform that aims to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate the borrowing process. Upstart’s artificial intelligence based **underwriting model** is able to identify high quality borrowers despite only being told limited information concerning the applicant’s credit and employment history.

## AI for Robotics
1. CloudMinds is different to other artificial intelligence companies in that instead of treating humans and robots as separate identities they seek to combine the two. This has allowed CloudMinds to make many interesting developments. The company has also developed a number of products for use in the wider world such as the blind guiding robot. CloudMinds Meta project has produced a helmet shaped device that can be worn by the visually impaired, allowing facial and object recognition as well as simple orientation and hazard avoidance.
2. Anki - The San Francisco based robotics and artificial intelligence start-up Anki aims to place robotic technology in children’s products. Anki’s Cozmo robot has been described as one of the most sophisticated available to the general public. This is largely because of its ability to respond emotionally to various situations.
3. UBTECH's innovation is the Jimu Robot. Unlike UBTECHs other ready made robots the Jimu is an interactive toy that allows children to not only build their own robot but also learn how to program it. The Jimu Robot, like other UBTECH products, are an important step towards making robots an everyday part of normal life.

## AI for Biotech and Genomics
1. Zynomics - focuses their efforts on integrating automation, genomics and machine learning. It has been able to combine a genetic library that is over two terabases in size with an intelligent and flexible core platform. This allows users to access new chemical building blocks and create unique material properties.

## AI Gamers
Open AI’s team of five neural networks, OpenAI Five, defeated human teams at Dota 2. AI bots just beat humans at the video game Dota 2. That’s a big deal because the victory required teamwork and collaboration – a huge milestone in advancing artificial intelligence

## AI for Debate - **OpenAI** co-founded by Elon Musk. Debate Game is intended to research wether machines debating a problem infront of a human judge

## AI Chip Makers
1. Nvidia
2. Intel Movidius Neural Compute Stick is a small, fanless, low powered, deep learning device that allows the user to learn artificial intelligence programming.Through its Arria FPGA processors Intel also provides artificial intelligence acceleration for Microsoft’s search engine, Bing.
3. Google - Tensor AI Chip
4. Cambricon - Cambricon’s performance/power ratio means that its chips can outperform many other CPUs and GPUs.
